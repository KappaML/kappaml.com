### Deliver Hyper-Personalized Experiences That Adapt Instantly

In today's digital landscape, users expect experiences tailored to their preferences, behaviors, and contextâ€”right now, not based on yesterday's data. KappaML's online AutoML platform empowers you to build personalization systems that learn and adapt in real-time, creating truly dynamic experiences that evolve with each interaction.

### The Challenge

Traditional personalization relies on batch-processed user profiles and static recommendation models. This approach fails to capture:

- **Immediate Intent**: What users want right now, not what they wanted last week
- **Context Shifts**: Changes in location, device, time of day, or mood
- **Trending Interests**: Rapidly evolving preferences and viral content
- **Session Evolution**: How user intent develops within a single session

)

# Real-time personalization
for user_event in event_stream:
    # Get personalized recommendations
    recommendations = engine.recommend(
        user_id=user_event.user_id,
        context=user_event.context,
        num_items=10
    )
    
    # Learn from user feedback
    if user_event.has_interaction:
        engine.learn(
            user_event,
            reward=user_event.get_reward()
        )
