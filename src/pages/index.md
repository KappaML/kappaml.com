        Can adapt to changes in the underlying data and overcome concept drift
        without retraining.

        The training process of a model happens over time. The model does not
        have to be retrained, resulting in low compute power requirements.

        More and more problems can now be solved with online machine learning.
        KappaML offers a wide range of models and algorithms to solve
        classification, regression, and recommendation problems.
  heading: Why Online AutoML with KappaML?
  description: "Traditionally, machine learning model training is done in a batch
    setting. Individuals or teams of data scientists select the model and its
    hyperparameters. Over time, this process is repeated to ensure the model's
    accuracy. KappaML proposes a different approach: continuously training and
    tuning an AutoML model on a data stream."
